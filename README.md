# Bike Buyers Purchase Analysis: Interactive Excel Dashboard
## Project Objective
The main goal of this project was to analyze customer demographics and purchasing behaviors to identify key trends and drivers for bike purchases. This analysis helps inform targeted marketing strategies to increase sales and optimize customer outreach. The dashboard visually presents insights related to income, marital status, gender, region, education, and commute distance.

## Dataset used
* <a href="https://github.com/Saniida-Mim-67/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Bike_buyers%20Dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a>: A raw dataset containing over 1,000 records of potential bike buyers.

## Tools
Tools: MS Excel (Power Query for cleaning, Pivot Tables for analysis, and dynamic Dashboard creation with Slicers).

## Questions (KPIs)
The analysis focused on answering the following Key Performance Indicators:
* What is the relationship between average income and purchase decisions across genders?
* How does customer commute distance influence the likelihood of a purchase?
* Which age brackets contribute most to the total number of orders?
* Which marital status, region, and education levels are most likely to buy?
* Dashboard Interaction: <a href="https://github.com/Saniida-Mim-67/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Screenshot%20(098).png"> View Dashboard </a>

## Process
* Data Cleaning & Validation: Verified data for missing values and anomalies, ensuring consistency in data types and formats.
* Pivot Table Creation: Generated several pivot tables to summarize data and visualize relationships between different columns to answer the defined KPIs.
* Interactive Dashboard: Consolidated all pivot tables and charts into a single, dynamic dashboard with interactive slicers (Marital Status, Region, Education) for instant data filtering and drill-down analysis.
