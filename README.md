# Bike Buyers Purchase Analysis: Interactive Excel Dashboard
## Project Objective
The main goal of this project was to analyze customer demographics and purchasing behaviors to identify key trends and drivers for bike purchases. This analysis helps inform targeted marketing strategies to increase sales and optimize customer outreach. The dashboard visually presents insights related to income, marital status, gender, region, education, and commute distance.

## Dataset used
* <a href="https://github.com/Saniida-Mim-67/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Bike_buyers%20Dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a>: A raw dataset containing over 1,000 records of potential bike buyers.

## Tools
Tools: MS Excel (Power Query for cleaning, Pivot Tables for analysis, and dynamic Dashboard creation with Slicers).

## Questions (KPIs)
The analysis focused on answering the following Key Performance Indicators:
* What is the relationship between average income and purchase decisions across genders?
* How does customer commute distance influence the likelihood of a purchase?
* Which age brackets contribute most to the total number of orders?
* Which marital status, region, and education levels are most likely to buy?
* Dashboard Interaction: <a href="https://github.com/Saniida-Mim-67/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Screenshot%20(098).png"> View Dashboard </a>

## Process
* Data Cleaning & Validation: Verified data for missing values and anomalies, ensuring consistency in data types and formats.
* Pivot Table Creation: Generated several pivot tables to summarize data and visualize relationships between different columns to answer the defined KPIs.
* Interactive Dashboard: Consolidated all pivot tables and charts into a single, dynamic dashboard with interactive slicers (Marital Status, Region, Education) for instant data filtering and drill-down analysis.

## Project Insights 
Based on the dashboard analysis:
* Gender and Income: On average, Male customers have a slightly higher average income (approx. $64,000) compared to female customers (approx. $62,500). The overall number of 'Yes' purchases appears balanced between genders.
* Commute Distance: The highest volume of total purchases occurs in the 0-1 Miles bracket. A key insight is that the 5-10 Miles segment shows a very high conversion rate (more 'Yes' responses than 'No' responses), identifying this as a high-potential target market.
* Age Brackets: The Middle Age customer segment accounts for the vast majority of all bike orders, making them the primary demographic focus.
* Region/Education: The dashboard interaction allows isolating specific demographics, such as identifying if North American customers with a Bachelor's degree are high-value targets when married.

## Final Conclusion:
To maximize sales, a strategic marketing plan should prioritize targeting middle-aged adults who fall within the 5-10 miles commute distance bracket, as this group exhibits a strong propensity to purchase bikes. Campaigns should leverage the dynamic filtering capability of the dashboard to create hyper-targeted messaging for specific regions and education levels.
